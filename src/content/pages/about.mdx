### So, about that “name”

So, about that “name”—let’s set the record straight. I’m not an egomaniac, and if you’re skeptical, that’s perfectly understandable. Those who truly know me would happily attest to the contrary. The title “Trek Stud” was not something I claimed for myself. I’m actually a landscape photographer, which is why I chose the name Trek Studio for my company. The name ‘Trek Studio’ combines ‘trek’ and ‘studio,’ reflecting my passion for outdoor photography. When I registered the domain trekstud.io, I thought I was being clever. Unfortunately, many people only read up to the period, which has led to some amusing misunderstandings.

In a playful spirit, my friends decided to tease me by calling me “Trek Stud” to embarrass me. Lightheartedly, I embraced the nickname and even adopted it as my trail name. It’s my world, and everyone should feel free to pursue their passions—even if it comes with a bit of teasing. Don’t judge me! 😁

### How it happened

I’ve been dabbling in website and graphic design for quite some time, both professionally and as a hobby, since the days of AOL and even earlier. Do you remember BBS? Yup, I just dated myself! 🤷

Photography, on the other hand, was a serendipitous discovery that quickly morphed into a true passion. Now, I see potential photo opportunities everywhere I look. So it was only a matter of time before I decided to establish a photography business and create my own brand. Over the years, all my hobbies gradually transformed into income streams, and I must say—it’s like living the dream.

### The Mission

My primary objective is to share the knowledge I gain daily. I hope to assist others with the information I once struggled to find myself.

At the heart of my mission is the ‘golden rule’—treat others as I would like to be treated. My aim is to provide factual and helpful information at all times. 💯

### The end game

Honestly, I find contentment in the simple things and lead a humble life. My main goal is to pursue my passions while ensuring my family’s well-being. While I may not be a dreamer in the traditional sense (I tend to prioritize practicality), above all, I am a devoted father 👨‍🍼.

My greatest desire is for my sons to feel a sense of pride in their father. Their happiness and admiration mean the world to me.
